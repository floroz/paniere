# Implementation Guides

This folder contains step-by-step implementation guides for one-time setup tasks that won't need to be consulted after completion.

## Available Guides

- **[Monorepo Implementation Guide](./monorepo-implementation-guide.md)** - Complete guide for transforming Paniere from a single React app into a TypeScript monorepo structure

## Purpose

These guides are designed for:

- **One-time setup/migration tasks**
- **Step-by-step implementation processes**
- **Historical reference of how the project was structured**

Once the implementation is complete, these guides serve as historical documentation but aren't needed for day-to-day development.

## For Ongoing Development

For day-to-day development workflows and patterns, refer to:

- [Development Workflow Guide](../development-workflow.md)
- [Current Architecture](../current-architecture.md)
- [ADR Documentation](../adr/)

## Checklist Status

All guides in this folder should have their checklists marked as completed (âœ…) to indicate the implementation has been finished.
