# Implementation Guides Overview

This directory contains step-by-step implementation guides for building Paniere's multiplayer functionality. Each guide is broken into manageable phases with checklists to track progress.

## Implementation Order

Follow these guides in sequence:

1. **[Monorepo Implementation Guide](./monorepo-implementation-guide.md)** âœ…
   - Status: Completed
   - Sets up the foundational monorepo structure

2. **[Multiplayer Implementation Guide (Revised)](./multiplayer-implementation-guide-revised.md)** ðŸš§
   - Status: In Progress
   - Broken into 8 phases for manageable implementation

## Master Progress Tracker

### âœ… Completed

- [x] Monorepo structure setup
- [x] TypeScript configuration
- [x] Shared types package
- [x] Basic frontend deployed to Netlify

### ðŸš§ Current Phase: Phase 0 - Local Development Environment

- [ ] Docker setup for Redis and PostgreSQL
- [ ] Development scripts
- [ ] Environment configuration

### ðŸ“‹ Upcoming Phases

#### Phase 1: Basic WebSocket Setup (2 days)

- [ ] Socket.io server setup
- [ ] Socket.io client implementation
- [ ] Basic connection testing

#### Phase 2: Authentication Integration (2 days)

- [ ] Clerk setup
- [ ] Frontend auth components
- [ ] Backend auth middleware

#### Phase 3: Redis Session Management (1 day)

- [ ] Redis client setup
- [ ] Session manager implementation
- [ ] Session persistence testing

#### Phase 4: Core Game Logic (3 days)

- [ ] Game state management
- [ ] Game creation/joining
- [ ] Number drawing logic

#### Phase 5: WebSocket Game Events (2 days)

- [ ] Typed Socket.io setup
- [ ] Event handlers
- [ ] Real-time game updates

#### Phase 6: Payment Integration (2 days)

- [ ] Stripe setup
- [ ] Payment flow
- [ ] Subscription management

#### Phase 7: Frontend Game UI (3 days)

- [ ] Game lobby
- [ ] Cartelle display
- [ ] Responsive design

### ðŸŽ¯ Milestones

1. **Local Multiplayer Working** (After Phase 5)
   - Two browsers can play together locally
   - Basic game functionality complete

2. **Monetization Ready** (After Phase 6)
   - Payment flow integrated
   - Free trial + paid games working

3. **Production Ready** (After Phase 7)
   - Full UI/UX implemented
   - Deployed to Railway/Netlify
   - Ready for beta testing

## Time Estimates

- **Total Implementation Time**: ~15 days
- **MVP Ready**: ~10 days (up to Phase 5)
- **Production Ready**: ~15 days (all phases)

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Frontend Hosting**: Staying with Netlify (already deployed)
2. **Backend Hosting**: Railway for MVP ($25/month)
3. **Authentication**: Clerk (generous free tier)
4. **Payments**: Stripe
5. **Real-time**: Socket.io with Redis adapter

## Important Notes

### Authentication Strategy Change

The original ADR suggested guest-only auth, but the monetization strategy requires:

- Guest access for players (no friction)
- Email auth for hosts (payment tracking)
- Using Clerk for simplified implementation

### Cost Considerations

- **Monthly Infrastructure**: ~$25 (Railway)
- **Per Transaction**: 2.9% + $0.30 (Stripe)
- **Break-even**: ~12 paid games/month

### Development Tips

1. Always run `npm run docker:up` before starting development
2. Use the checklists in each guide to track progress
3. Test with multiple browsers for multiplayer features
4. Keep Redis GUI open (RedisInsight) for debugging

## Getting Help

- **Socket.io Issues**: Check connection logs in browser console
- **Redis Issues**: Use `docker logs paniere_redis`
- **Auth Issues**: Check Clerk dashboard and logs
- **Payment Issues**: Use Stripe test mode and webhook CLI

## Next Steps After Implementation

1. Beta testing with real families
2. Performance optimization
3. Analytics implementation
4. Marketing website updates
5. Launch preparation for Christmas 2024
