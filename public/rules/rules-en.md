# Tombola: Rules and Instructions

## Introduction

Tombola (also known as Italian Bingo) is a traditional Neapolitan game typically played during holidays and family gatherings, especially during Christmas and New Year celebrations. It's a game of chance that brings people together in a fun and engaging way.

## Game Components

- **Tabellone (Game Board)**: A board with numbers from 1 to 90 arranged in rows.
- **Cartelle (Game Cards)**: Each player receives one or more cards. Each card has a 3×9 grid with 15 numbers distributed across the grid.
- **Tombola Set**: A set of 90 numbered tokens (1-90) which are drawn randomly during the game.

## Game Setup

1. **Distribute Cartelle**: Each player receives one or more cartelle.
2. **Select a Caller**: One person will be responsible for drawing numbers and calling them out.
3. **Prepare the Tokens**: Place all 90 numbered tokens in a container for drawing.

## How to Play

1. **Drawing Numbers**: The caller randomly draws a token, announces the number, and places it on the Tabellone.
2. **Marking Numbers**: Players check their cartelle and mark any matching numbers.
3. **Announcing Wins**: When a player completes a specific pattern, they call out the corresponding prize category.
4. **Verification**: The caller verifies the player's claim by checking the called numbers against their cartella.
5. **Continue Playing**: The game continues until all prize categories are awarded or all 90 numbers have been drawn.

## Prize Categories

Tombola has several prize categories, awarded progressively as more numbers are drawn:

1. **Ambo**: Two numbers marked in the same row (2/5 numbers).
2. **Terno**: Three numbers marked in the same row (3/5 numbers).
3. **Quaterna**: Four numbers marked in the same row (4/5 numbers).
4. **Cinquina**: All five numbers marked in a single row (5/5 numbers).
5. **Tombola**: All numbers on a cartella are marked (15/15 numbers). This is the grand prize!

## Understanding Your Cartella

- Each cartella has a 3×9 grid (3 rows, 9 columns).
- Only 15 of the 27 cells contain numbers (5 numbers per row).
- The numbers are arranged by decades:
  - Column 1: numbers 1-9
  - Column 2: numbers 10-19
  - Column 3: numbers 20-29
  - And so on, with Column 9 containing numbers 80-90
